# DSTorch
This project is to build a lightweight, PyTorch-based neural network training platform. Existing platforms like PyTorch Lightning or MMDetection are becoming heavier and more complex over time. To address this issue, DSTorch is designed so that it contains only source files, each dedicated to one of: dataset, optimization, model, parameters, train/eval, and loss. Even though the source files are well connected to make train.py runnable, you must define your own model, dataset, parameters, optimizer, and loss for the task at hand. This will give you the freedom to think creatively and work flexibly, even though it sometimes gets your hands dirty.
